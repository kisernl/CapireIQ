## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

This project is a clean and minimalist flashcard study app designed to allow a user to quickly add data (via csv) to create decks of flashcards. The user's "cards" are organized in "decks" and their "decks" are organized in "stacks". The design seeks to help users leveage their favorite AI chatbot to simply generate csv which they easily copy and paste. The app uses Appwrite Auth to provide security for the user's flashcard data. The app stores flashcard data in an Appwrite Database. And the app allows a user to delete their account and flashcard data through calling an Appwrite Function.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

I built this project to provide a simple yet powerful tool for my sons to use in their own study workflows. I have a son in high school, and a son in middle school. Both have struggled to find workable solutions for creating flashcards for their various courses. The apps their schools provide are not flexible and are cumbersome for building custom decks of flashcards.  I wanted to build a solution that would allow them to create their own study system, utilize AI chatbots to create flashcards for them (from their class notes or from thoughtful prompts), and be readily accessible from their iPad, phone, or a laptop.  I really enjoyed brainstorming with them as I created this app, builidng features they said would be helpful (for instance: including a simple manual card creation option), as well as creating a roadmap for how I can continue to build on this app in the future!
